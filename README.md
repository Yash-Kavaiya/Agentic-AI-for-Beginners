## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the world of Agentic AI! This repository aims to be your complete resource for learning about autonomous AI systems that can perform tasks with minimal human supervision.

### 🔍 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can:

- 🎯 Operate autonomously to achieve goals
- 🤔 Make decisions based on context and objectives
- 🔄 Learn from interactions and feedback
- 🛠️ Use tools and APIs to accomplish tasks

## 📚 Learning Path

| Level | Topics | Projects |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Beginner** | Foundations, LLMs, Basic Tools | Simple chatbot agent |
| **Intermediate** | Planning, Memory, Tool usage | Task automation agent |
| **Advanced** | Multi-agent systems, Evaluation | Complex workflow agent |

## 🧩 Core Components

### 1️⃣ Foundation Models

The building blocks of modern agentic systems:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Multimodal Models
- Specialized Models

### 2️⃣ Reasoning & Planning

How agents think and plan:

- Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
- Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
- ReAct Prompting

### 3️⃣ Memory Systems

How agents remember information:

- Short-term context
- Long-term vector stores
- Structured memory

### 4️⃣ Tool Usage

How agents interact with the world:

- API Integration
- Code Execution
- Web Browsing
