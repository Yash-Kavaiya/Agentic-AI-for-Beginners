## 🔤 A-Z of Agentic AI Terms

### 🤖 Agent
An autonomous or semi-autonomous AI system capable of perceiving its environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve specific goals.

### 🧠 Agency
The capacity of an AI system to act independently, make decisions, and take actions on behalf of a user or to achieve specified goals.

### 🎯 Action Space
The set of all possible actions an agent can take in its environment.

### 🔄 Autonomous System
A system that can operate and make decisions with little to no human intervention.

### 🧩 API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. Agents often use APIs to interact with external services.

### 🔍 Attention Mechanism
A component in neural networks that helps the model focus on specific parts of the input data when performing tasks.

### 🌐 AutoGPT
An experimental open-source application that demonstrates autonomous GPT-4 capabilities through self-prompting.

### 👶 BabyAGI
A simple task management system powered by AI that autonomously generates and prioritizes tasks.

### 🔄 Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) Model
A framework for modeling rational agents that separates an agent's beliefs (knowledge about the world), desires (goals), and intentions (plans to achieve goals).

### 🔄 Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
A prompting technique that encourages language models to break down complex reasoning into step-by-step thinking.

### 🤝 CrewAI
A framework for orchestrating multiple AI agents to work together on complex tasks.

### 🧠 Cognitive Architecture
A framework that describes the structure of an intelligent agent's mind, including perception, memory, learning, and decision-making processes.

### 🛠️ Disambiguation
The process of resolving ambiguity in user requests or inputs to determine the correct interpretation.

### 🔄 Embodied AI
AI systems that interact with and learn from the physical world through sensors and actuators.

### 🌟 Emergent Behavior
Complex behaviors that arise from the interaction of simpler components or rules, often not explicitly programmed.

### 🔍 Evaluation Function
A function that assesses the performance or utility of an agent's actions or decisions.

### 🧠 Foundation Model
Large-scale AI models trained on vast datasets that serve as the basis for various downstream applications through fine-tuning or prompting.

### 🤝 Function Calling
The ability of language models to identify when a function should be called, determine which function to use, and generate the proper JSON to pass as arguments.

### 📊 GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
A type of large language model architecture developed by OpenAI, known for its natural language understanding and generation capabilities.

### 🎮 Hierarchical Planning
A planning approach where complex tasks are broken down into simpler subtasks in a hierarchical structure.

### 🔄 Instruction Tuning
Fine-tuning a language model on a dataset of instructions and appropriate responses to improve its ability to follow user directions.

### 🔍 Intent Recognition
The process of identifying the purpose or goal behind a user's request or query.

### 🔁 Iterative Refinement
The process of repeatedly improving a solution or output based on feedback or evaluation.

### 🧩 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
A lightweight data interchange format commonly used for communication between agents and APIs.

### 🔑 Knowledge Base
A structured repository of information that an agent can query to inform its decisions and actions.

### 🔄 LangChain
A framework for developing applications powered by language models, focusing on composability and integrations.

### 📝 LLM (Large Language Model)
A neural network with billions of parameters trained on vast text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

### 🧠 Memory Systems
Components that enable agents to store and retrieve information across different time scales.

### 🤝 Multi-Agent System
A system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents working together to solve problems.

### 🌐 Multimodal AI
AI systems that can process and generate multiple types of data (text, images, audio, etc.).

### 🎯 Objective Function
A mathematical function that defines what an agent is trying to optimize or achieve.

### 📋 Planning
The process of determining a sequence of actions to achieve a specific goal.

### 🔍 Prompt Engineering
The practice of crafting effective prompts to guide language models toward desired outputs.

### 📊 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
A technique that enhances text generation by retrieving relevant information from external sources.

### 🤔 ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
A prompting framework that interleaves reasoning traces and task-specific actions to generate responses.

### 🔄 Reinforcement Learning
A machine learning approach where agents learn optimal behaviors through trial and error and receiving rewards.

### 🔍 Semantic Search
Search techniques that understand the meaning and context of queries rather than just matching keywords.

### 🧩 State Space
The set of all possible states an agent might encounter in its environment.

### 🌳 Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
An extension of Chain-of-Thought that explores multiple reasoning paths and evaluates them to solve complex problems.

### 🛠️ Tool Use
The ability of an agent to use external tools, APIs, or functions to accomplish tasks.

### 🎯 Task Decomposition
Breaking down complex tasks into simpler, manageable subtasks.

### 🔄 Vector Database
A specialized database that stores and retrieves data based on similarity in a high-dimensional vector space.

### 📊 Working Memory
A temporary memory system that holds information currently being processed by an agent.

### 🔍 Zero-Shot Learning
The ability of a model to perform tasks it wasn't explicitly trained on, without specific examples.
